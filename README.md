# Number Guesser Game

### Introduction
In this project, JavaScript functions are used to power a small browser based guessing game. At the beginning of each round: 

- The user selects and enters a number between 1-10. 
- The game will then generate a random number between 1-10 and set it as the 'target number' for that round. 
- Finally the computer opponent will 'guess' a number between 1-10.
- Whichever players number is closest to the target number wins the round.
